# how-to-hire-engineers
Spawned from a series of recurring discussions that keep popping up around the internet on how hiring sucks and how to improve the candidate experience, this repos is intended to collect a series of works on the subject of how to sit on the other side of the hiring table.

## Preamble: Why interview?

- _signal_
- fit cultural
- fit complement
- compensation

## Any great guides / articles for engineers who are new to interviewing?

- Kyle (the javascript guy) - great post on obtaining signal
- Laurie (twitter & lego) - her blog probably has some thoughts
- Jem Young - collect notes from frontent masters course
- interesting link on retention: https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-chicago/program/pete-cheslock 
  > I had watched so many companies spend countless time and energy in order to recruit the best staff possible. But after you were in the door, it seems like none of them really cared about how you might retain all those people you spent years investing in

> We found it an interesting exercise (besides hiring, but also in support of hiring) to do a "technology and skill landscape" write-up.
In other words, looking at all the software products and modules, what technology is used (for development, testing, deployment, monitoring, etc.) as well as the type of skills needed (we frame it in the pioneer-settler-town planner) and then wrote up where we want to be (e.g. standardize on certain development, deployment, testing, etc. technologies where necessary) and then it seemed to reveal what sort of skills we were lacking.
Not sure if that makes sense (I can answer questions in :thread: ) but in essence: where are we - where do we want to be - what do we lack for product, technology and skills
