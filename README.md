# how-to-hire-engineers
Spawned from a series of recurring discussions that keep popping up around the internet on how hiring sucks and how to improve the candidate experience, this repos is intended to collect a series of works on the subject of how to sit on the other side of the hiring table.

## A note on this document

Thanks for stopping by! The goal of this project is to help compile a working set of best practices within technology hiring. Production of the document will be built out in stages as I get time. I expect to be able to dedicate 1 to 2 hours a week on this and schedule the work night around other side projects (the current priority of this ranks as a side project to my side project so you can expect a certain, incredibly hacky level of quality here).

I expect the project will have a number of phases:

- **phase 1**: compile documents and available information on the topic turning this into a curated list of docs
- **phase 2**: read, summarize and organize existing advice into clustered recommendations
- **phase 3**: synthesize the clusters into a robust framework in creating a great candidate experience that is both valid and reliable

## Preamble: Why interview?

- _signal_
- fit cultural
- fit complement
- compensation

## Any great guides / articles for engineers who are new to interviewing?

> We found it an interesting exercise (besides hiring, but also in support of hiring) to do a "technology and skill landscape" write-up.
In other words, looking at all the software products and modules, what technology is used (for development, testing, deployment, monitoring, etc.) as well as the type of skills needed (we frame it in the pioneer-settler-town planner) and then wrote up where we want to be (e.g. standardize on certain development, deployment, testing, etc. technologies where necessary) and then it seemed to reveal what sort of skills we were lacking.
Not sure if that makes sense (I can answer questions in :thread: ) but in essence: where are we - where do we want to be - what do we lack for product, technology and skills

also via Mojtaba in his reading of the talent war:

> Reading a book and it says these about hiring:
> - Hire for what you can't teach
> - Hire for character, not skill, nor experience
> - Character is not the same as personality (or likeability)
> - Do not overemphasize hiring based on prior experience
> - Do not factor in industry experience
> - Just because it's hard to hire for character and potential and easier to hire for experience/skill, don't go for the easy option

This is not to say that we should under-value work experience HOWEVER 

> 1. one should really make sure that experience is relevant before making it a filter
> 1. if above is true, one should really make sure that the _minimum_ bar is set to be the _true minimum_
> ultimately you should consider and evaluate candidate's experience, but don't _obsess_ over it
