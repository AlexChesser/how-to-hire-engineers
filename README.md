# how-to-hire-engineers
Spawned from a series of recurring discussions that keep popping up around the internet on how hiring sucks and how to improve the candidate experience, this repos is intended to collect a series of works on the subject of how to sit on the other side of the hiring table.

## Preamble: Why interview?

- _signal_
- fit cultural
- fit complement
- compensation

## Any great guides / articles for engineers who are new to interviewing?

- Kyle (the javascript guy) - great post on obtaining signal
- Laurie (twitter & lego) - her blog probably has some thoughts
- Jem Young - collect notes from frontent masters course
- interesting link on retention: https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-chicago/program/pete-cheslock 
  > I had watched so many companies spend countless time and energy in order to recruit the best staff possible. But after you were in the door, it seems like none of them really cared about how you might retain all those people you spent years investing in
