# how-to-hire-engineers
Spawned from a series of recurring discussions that keep popping up around the internet on how hiring sucks and how to improve the candidate experience, this repos is intended to collect a series of works on the subject of how to sit on the other side of the hiring table.

## Preamble: Why interview?

- _signal_
- fit cultural
- fit complement
- compensation

## Any great guides / articles for engineers who are new to interviewing?

- Kyle (the javascript guy) - great post on obtaining signal
- Laurie (twitter & lego) - her blog probably has some thoughts
- Jem Young - collect notes from frontent masters course
